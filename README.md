_Success Through Failure_

Learning how to code is difficult. There are a lot of failures along the way. However, failures are a great catalyst for success. At YeetCode, we believe that if you know enough incorrect solutions to a problem, you can derive the correct answer. Practicing with YeetCode will help you learn all the approaches that don't work, so that when you are faced with an important task you can easily avoid suboptimal solutions.
